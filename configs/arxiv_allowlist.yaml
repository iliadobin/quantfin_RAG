  summary: We are interested in the existence of equivalent martingale measures and
    the detection of arbitrage opportunities in markets where several multi-asset
    derivatives are traded simultaneously. More specifically, we consider a financial
    market with multiple traded assets whose marginal risk-neutral distributions are
    known, and assume that several derivatives written on these assets are traded
    simultaneously. In this setting, there is a bijection between the existence of
    an equivalent martingale meas

  summary: In this study, we discuss a machine learning technique to price exotic
    options with two underlying assets based on a non-Gaussian Levy process model.
    We introduce a new multivariate Levy process model named the generalized normal
    tempered stable (gNTS) process, which is defined by time-changed multivariate
    Brownian motion. Since the gNTS process does not provide a simple analytic formula
    for the probability density function (PDF), we use the conditional real-valued
    non-volume preserving (CRealNV

  summary: Standard jump-diffusion models assume independence between jumps and diffusion
    components. We develop a multi-type jump-diffusion model where jump occurrence
    and magnitude depend on contemporaneous diffusion movements. Unlike previous one-sided
    models that create arbitrage opportunities, our framework includes upward and
    downward jumps triggered by both large upward and large downward diffusion increments.
    We derive the explicit no-arbitrage condition linking the physical drift to model

  summary: In incomplete financial markets, there exists a set of equivalent martingale
    measures (or risk-neutral probabilities) in an arbitrage-free pricing of the contingent
    claims. Minimax expectation is closely related to the $g$-expectation which is
    the solution of a certain stochastic differential equation. We show that Choquet
    expectation and minimax expectation are equal in pricing European type options,
    whose payoff is a monotone function of the terminal stock price $S_T$.

  summary: The Local Volatility model is a well-known extension of the Black-Scholes
    constant volatility model whereby the volatility is dependent on both time and
    the underlying asset. This model can be calibrated to provide a perfect fit to
    a wide range of implied volatility surfaces. The model is easy to calibrate and
    still very popular in FX option trading. In this paper we address a question of
    validation of the Local Volatility model. Different stochastic models for the
    underlying can be calibrated t

  summary: In the paper, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the implied volatility
    of a basket call option at large and small strikes in a variety of settings with
    increasing generality. First, we obtain an asymptotic formula with an error bound
    for the left wing of the implied volatility, under the assumption that the dynamics
    of asset prices are described by the multidimensional Black-Scholes model. Next,
    we find the leading term of asymptotics of the implied volatility in the case
    where the asse

  summary: We observe that a European Call option with strike $L > K$ can be seen
    as a Call option with strike $L-K$ on a Call option with strike $K$. Under no
    arbitrage assumptions, this yields immediately that the prices of the two contracts
    are the same, in full generality. We study in detail the relative pricing function
    which gives the price of the Call on Call option as a function of its underlying
    Call option, and provide quasi-closed formula for those new pricing functions

  summary: On April 22, 2020, the CME Group switched to Bachelier pricing for a group
    of oil futures options. The Bachelier model, or more generally the arithmetic
    Brownian motion (ABM), is not so widely used in finance, though. This paper provides
    the first comprehensive survey of options pricing under ABM. Using the risk-neutral
    valuation, we derive formulas for European options for three underlying types,
    namely an underlying that does not pay dividends, an underlying that pays a continuous
    dividend yie

  summary: The main purpose of this article is to give a general overview and understanding
    of the first widely used option-pricing model, the Black-Scholes model. The history
    and context are presented, with the usefulness and implications in the economics
    world. A brief review of fundamental calculus concepts is introduced to derive
    and solve the model. The equation is then resolved using both an analytical (variable
    separation) and a numerical method (finite differences). Conclusions are drawn

  summary: This paper presents a new model for options pricing. The Black-Scholes-Merton
    (BSM) model plays an important role in financial options pricing. However, the
    BSM model assumes that the risk-free interest rate, volatility, and equity premium
    are constant, which is unrealistic in the real market. To address this, our paper
    considers the time-varying characteristics of those parameters. Our model integrates
    elements of the BSM model, the Heston (1993) model for stochastic variance, the
    Vasicek model

  summary: We develop generic and efficient importance sampling estimators for Monte
    Carlo evaluation of prices of single- and multi-asset European and path-dependent
    options in asset price models driven by Lévy processes, extending earlier works
    which focused on the Black-Scholes and continuous stochastic volatility models.
    Using recent results from the theory of large deviations on the path space for
    processes with independent increments, we compute an explicit asymptotic approximation

  summary: Pricing options is an important problem in financial engineering. In many
    scenarios of practical interest, financial option prices associated to an underlying
    asset reduces to computing an expectation w.r.t.~a diffusion process. In general,
    these expectations cannot be calculated analytically, and one way to approximate
    these quantities is via the Monte Carlo method; Monte Carlo methods have been
    used to price options since at least the 1970's. It has been seen in Del Moral,

  summary: The rough Bergomi model, introduced by Bayer, Friz and Gatheral [Quant.
    Finance 16(6), 887-904, 2016], is one of the recent rough volatility models that
    are consistent with the stylised fact of implied volatility surfaces being essentially
    time-invariant, and are able to capture the term structure of skew observed in
    equity markets. In the absence of analytical European option pricing methods for
    the model, we focus on reducing the runtime-adjusted variance of Monte Carlo implied
    volatilities, t

  summary: American options in a multi-asset market model with proportional transaction
    costs are studied in the case when the holder of an option is able to exercise
    it gradually at a so-called mixed (randomised) stopping time. The introduction
    of gradual exercise leads to tighter bounds on the option price when compared
    to the case studied in the existing literature, where the standard assumption
    is that the option can only be exercised instantly at an ordinary stopping time.

  summary: In this paper, we adopt the least squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method to
    price time-capped American options. The aforementioned cap can be an independent
    random variable or dependent on asset price at random time. We allow various time
    caps. In particular, we give an algorithm for pricing the American options capped
    by the first drawdown epoch. We focus on the geometric Lévy market. We prove that
    our estimator converges to the true price as one takes the discretisation step
    tending to zero and the
